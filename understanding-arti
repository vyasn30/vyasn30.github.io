#understanding arti: A Rust Tor Implementation. 

## findings by running arti in debug mode:

Start arti by the command '''arti proxy'''. For the purpose of document, I have used arti in the debug mode i.e. '''arti --log-level debug proxy""". At the time of writing this I just have a very high level of understanding of TOR. The goal is to read the debug logs and explore the codebase.
